    person(given = "Salim",
           family = "BrÃ¼ggemann",

Description: salim includes a diverse mix of functions
    which have not found their home in a more suitable place yet. The
    package kinda serves as an incubator for not yet fully matured code
    and thus will most probably never be made available through CRAN.
