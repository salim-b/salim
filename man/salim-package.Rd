\title{salim: A Wild Mix of Functions Serving Various Purposes}
\description{
salim includes a diverse mix of functions which have not
    found their home in a more suitable place yet. The package kinda
    serves as an incubator for not yet fully matured code and thus will
    most probably never be made available through CRAN.
